        <h2>General</h2>

        <p>The Town of Hartland is bisected by the Barkhamsted Reservoir into the communities of East and West Hartland. Each has its own volunteer fire department which provides emergency services to the respective communities and to neighboring areas through mutual aid agreements. Both departments eagerly welcome prospective members interested in emergency service activities, and each holds its monthly meeting on the first Tuesday of the month, East Hartland at 8:00 p.m., and West Hartland at 7:00 p.m.</p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>

        <p> The objective of each of the Town's two fire departments is to provide fire fighting, rescue, limited medical services, and related activities to Town residents to the extent of their capabilities and to coordinate delivery of additional resources when necessary through mutual aid agreements.</p>

    <section class="Organization">
        <h2>Organization</h2>

        <p>Each department is a private corporation managed by elected administrative officers. Firefighting and rescue functions are managed by a Chief, Assistant Chief, and two/three additional line officers. Each department is equipped with two pumpers, and a tanker for water supply (as there are no hydrants in town). In addition, West Hartland VFD operates a brush truck and a rescue truck, while East Hartland VFD operates a rescue truck. The rescue trucks are for EMS calls, vehicle extrication, and light rescue.</p>
